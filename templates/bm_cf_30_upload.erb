# Which method to use for uploading archives, you can put 
# multiple methods here.
# Available methods:
# - scp
# - ssh-gpg
# - ftp
# - rsync
# - s3
# - none

# If you don't want to use any upload method (you don't want to
# upload files to remote hosts) then choose "none"

# Where to put archives on the remote hosts (global)
export BM_UPLOAD_DESTINATION="<%= @destination %>"

# Uncomment the 'export ...' line below to activate the uploaded archives
# database.
# Using the database will avoid extraneous uploads to remote hosts in the
# case of running more than one backup-manager jobs per day (such as when
# you are using different configuration files for different parts of your
# filesystem).
# Note that when you upload to multiple hosts, a single succesfull upload
# will mark the archive as uploaded. Thus upload errors to specific hosts
# will have to be resolved manually.
# You can specify any filename, but it is recommended to keep the database
# inside the archive repository. The variable's value has been preset to
# that.
#export BM_UPLOADED_ARCHIVES=${BM_REPOSITORY_ROOT}/${BM_ARCHIVE_PREFIX}-uploaded.list
