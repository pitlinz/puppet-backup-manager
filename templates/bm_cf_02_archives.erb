##############################################################

# If you want to encrypt your archives locally, Backup Manager 
# can use GPG while building the archive (so the archive is never
# written to the disk without being encrypted.

# Note: this feature is only possible with the following archive types:
# tar, tar.gz, tar.bz2

# Uncomment the following line if you want to enable encryption
# available method: gpg
export BM_ENCRYPTION_METHOD="false"

# The encryption will be made using a GPG ID
# Examples:
# export BM_ENCRYPTION_RECIPIENT=""
# export BM_ENCRYPTION_RECIPIENT=""
export BM_ENCRYPTION_RECIPIENT=""
