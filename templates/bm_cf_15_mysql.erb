# Backup method: MYSQL
#############################################################

# This method is dedicated to MySQL databases.
# You should not use the tarball method for backing up database
# directories or you may have corrupted archives.
# Enter here the list of databases to backup.
# Wildcard: __ALL__ (will dump all the databases in one archive)

# The best way to produce MySQL dump is done by using the "--opt" switch 
# of mysqldump. This make the dump directly usable with mysql (add the drop table
# statements), lock the tables during the dump and other things.
# This is recommended for full-clean-safe backups, but needs a 
# privileged user (for the lock permissions).

# the host where the database is
export BM_MYSQL_HOST="<%= @host %>"

# the port where MySQL listen to on the host
export BM_MYSQL_PORT="<%= @port %>"

# which compression format to use? (gzip or bzip2)

# (take care to what you do; this will be silently added to the 
# command line.)
